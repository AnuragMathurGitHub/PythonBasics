# Problem Solving Basics

This folder contains basic problem-solving tasks to build a strong foundation in Python.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Reverse an Array
Write a program to reverse an array.

#### Solution:
The solution is implemented in the file `reverse_array.py`.

### Task 2: Check Palindrome
Check if a string is a palindrome (same forward & backward).

#### Solution:
The solution is implemented in the file `check_palindrome.py`.

### Task 3: Sum of Digits
Find the sum of digits of a number.

#### Solution:
The solution is implemented in the file `sum_of_digits.py`.

### Task 4: FizzBuzz Problem
Print numbers from 1 to 20, but:
- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
- If divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
- If divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

#### Solution:
The solution is implemented in the file `fizzbuzz.py`.

## How to Run

1. Run the reverse array script:
    ```
    python reverse_array.py
    ```

2. Run the check palindrome script:
    ```
    python check_palindrome.py
    ```

3. Run the sum of digits script:
    ```
    python sum_of_digits.py
    ```

4. Run the FizzBuzz script:
    ```
    python fizzbuzz.py
    ```

## Next Steps

We will start with Pandas and NumPy, which are foundational for AI/ML.
